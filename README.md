# House-Price-Prediction

This project demonstrates the application of various regression algorithms to predict house prices based on multiple features from a housing dataset. The pipeline includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training with hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and interpretation.

Key steps in the project:

Data Loading and Cleaning: The dataset is loaded, checked for missing values, and cleaned.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, feature distributions, scatter plots, and boxplots help understand the data and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding, and numeric features are scaled for better model performance.

Modeling: Multiple regression models are trained and tuned, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressor.

Evaluation: Models are compared using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Visualizations of actual vs. predicted values and residuals are provided.

Feature Importance: For the Random Forest model, the top features influencing house prices are identified and visualized.

This end-to-end approach provides insight into how different machine learning models perform on a real-world regression problem and highlights the importance of data preprocessing and model tuning.
